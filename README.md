# init.vim
A **terrible** vim scipt for my neovim configuration.please review each file before using the configuration.

**Note**: This config uses [xclip](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xclip-git) for linux/mac and [copyq](https://github.com/hluk/CopyQ) for windows for implementing clipboard. you can remove [this](https://github.com/Justaus3r/init.vim/blob/Master/configs/mappings.vim#L7) function(and its mapping) if you have clipboard builtin to vim/neovim.
